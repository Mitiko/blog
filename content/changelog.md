This is a list of the more major changes on the site, most not reflected in the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/mitiko/blog).

The idea for a blog probably wanders every programmer's mind at some point. And
they usually do spend way more time building and customizing their own framework
than actually writing articles. My blog's journey began the same way. At first I
really wanted to use .NET, as that was the coolest web thing I knew. But my
blog's journey really started when I discovered the [JAM stack](https://jamstack.wtf).

## Markdown & Hugo

Having collected a bunch of links of cool blogs I've liked, I quickly discovered
I like the minimal, yet functional aesthetic that 90s websites gave off.

When writing blogs your content is primarily text, HTML is often wayy too
verbose for the purposes & markdown is quite the perfect fit. Whenever you do
need HTML, you can just type it in, and modern templating frameworks give you
all the extensibility you would need.

Templates? You got it! Metadata? We love TOML!

- wrote lit12.top with Hugo
- liked the prebuilt templates

## Moving to Zola

- docs not so great
- written in rust so I can contribute

- minimal
- not as many extensions tho

- better than github pages
  - functions
  - one-click pre-built optimizations (html, css, js)
  - no DNSSEC
  - honestly a bit slow at the edge
  - didn't get the pricing

## Domain from OVH

- bought a domain
  - domain management sucked
  - site slow
  - site weird with many languages

## New domain from Porkbun

Bought a new domain at Porkbun.

- extra fast & care about people
- very good free tier
  - pricing after makes sense
