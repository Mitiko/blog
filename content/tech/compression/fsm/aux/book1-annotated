DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK -- AN INCIDENT
When Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth
spread till they were within <span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_0"> </span>unimport<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_1">t</span> dist<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_2">c</span>e of
his ears, his eyes were reduced to chinks, <span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_3">d</span> diverging
wrinkles appeared round them, extending upon his
counten<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_2">c</span>e like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of
the rising sun.
His Christi<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_0"> </span>name was Gabriel, <span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_3">d</span> on working
days he was a young m<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_0"> </span>of sound judgment, easy
motions, proper dress, <span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_3">d</span> general good character. On
Sundays he was a m<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_0"> </span>of misty views, rather given to
postponing, <span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_3">d</span> hampered by his best clothes <span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_3">d</span>
umbrella : upon the whole, one who felt himself to
occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean
neutrality which lay between the Communion people
of the parish <span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_3">d</span> the drunken section, -- that is, he went
to church, but yawned privately by the time the con+
gegation reached the Nicene creed,- <span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_3">d</span> thought of
what there would be for dinner when he me<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_1">t</span> to be
listening to the sermon. Or, to state his character as
it stood in the scale of public opinion, when his friends
<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_3">d</span> critics were in t<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_1">t</span>rums, he was considered rather a
bad m<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_0"> </span>; when they were pleased, he was rather a good
m<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_0"> </span>; when they were neither, he was a m<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_0"> </span>whose
moral colour was a kind of pepper-<span class="ctx">an</span><span class="_3">d</span>-salt mixture.
