DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK -- AN INCIDENT
When Farmer Oak smiled, <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>corners of his mouth
spread till <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_1">y</span> were within an unimportant distance of
his ears, his eyes were reduced to chinks, and diverging
wrinkles appeared round <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_2">m</span>, extending upon his
countenance like <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>rays in a rudimentary sketch of
<span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>rising sun.
His Christian name was Gabriel, and on working
days he was a young man of sound judgment, easy
motions, proper dress, and general good character. On
Sundays he was a man of misty views, ra<span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_3">r</span> given to
postponing, and hampered by his best clo<span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_4">s</span> and
umbrella : upon <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>whole, one who felt himself to
occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean
neutrality which lay between <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>Communion people
of <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>parish and <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>drunken section, -- that is, he went
to church, but yawned privately by <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>time <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>con+
gegation reached <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>Nicene creed,- and thought of
what <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_3">r</span>e would be for dinner when he meant to be
listening to <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>sermon. Or, to state his character as
it stood in <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_0"> </span>scale of public opinion, when his friends
and critics were in tantrums, he was considered ra<span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_3">r</span> a
bad man ; when <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_1">y</span> were pleased, he was ra<span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_3">r</span> a good
man ; when <span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_1">y</span> were nei<span class="ctx">the</span><span class="_3">r</span>, he was a man whose
moral colour was a kind of pepper-and-salt mixture.
