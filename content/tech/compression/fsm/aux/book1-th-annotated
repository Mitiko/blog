DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK -- AN INCIDENT
When Farmer Oak smiled, <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> corners of his mouth
spread till <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>y were wi<span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_1">i</span>n an unimportant distance of
his ears, his eyes were reduced to chinks, and diverging
wrinkles appeared round <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>m, extending upon his
countenance like <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> rays in a rudimentary sketch of
<span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> rising sun.
His Christian name was Gabriel, and on working
days he was a young man of sound judgment, easy
motions, proper dress, and general good character. On
Sundays he was a man of misty views, ra<span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>r given to
postponing, and hampered by his best clo<span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>s and
umbrella : upon <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> whole, one who felt himself to
occupy morally <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_2">a</span>t vast middle space of Laodicean
neutrality which lay between <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> Communion people
of <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> parish and <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> drunken section, -- <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_2">a</span>t is, he went
to church, but yawned privately by <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> time <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> con+
gegation reached <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> Nicene creed,- and <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_3">o</span>ught of
what <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>re would be for dinner when he meant to be
listening to <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> sermon. Or, to state his character as
it stood in <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span> scale of public opinion, when his friends
and critics were in tantrums, he was considered ra<span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>r a
bad man ; when <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>y were pleased, he was ra<span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>r a good
man ; when <span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>y were nei<span class="ctx">th</span><span class="_0">e</span>r, he was a man whose
moral colour was a kind of pepper-and-salt mixture.
