As sorted by complexity of learning

## "Learning data compression"?
- no free lunch,
- pigeonhole principle
- LZ77, LZ78
- Entropy Coding (Golomb, Shannon-Fano, Huffman, Arithmetic, ANS)

## "Data compression theory"
- proof of pigeonhole principle (coq?)
- proof of arithmetic (coq)
- proof of lzss?

## "Data compression in practice"
- Demistifying the arithemtic coder
- Weaponizing ANS (ANS is like arith, state is just optimization)
  - show how ANS appends digits on the other side
  - js with observable
