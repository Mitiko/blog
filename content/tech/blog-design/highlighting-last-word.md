TODO:
Mention:
1) css first letter selection
2) the messy business with () and "" -- maybe mention that later for the patched version


Next:
1) Taxonomies?
2) 404 page and setting up domains -- ooh, buying the domain should be in getting started
3) Adding TODO in the project with .gitignore
4) Organizing section templates
5) Doing the section as list of pages render
6) Patch version
