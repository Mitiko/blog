Have you seen the wild subtitles on tiktoks (or reels or youtube shorts)?
*Text is retro again*!

In middle school we had the coolest music teacher.
She was a very opinionated elderly woman and was very keen on teaching us
a lot of various general knowledge.
I don't think I've seen her since but she is one of my idols.

She had all these unconventional / unorthodox teaching methods. Not for the
entirety of the material she is required to teach us but for certain topics
when she truly believed it's crucial we remember.

One of them was making us shout "Donka Petrova e ..."? <!-- TODO: -->
so loud everyone in the corridors would hear. the incentive was that the phrase
would be something so popular amongst the teens that we'd shout it loud enough
if given the choice rather than staying quiet.

Anyway.
One of the fewest memories that has still stuck with me is when I got an A for
answering "why has music become faster over the decades?". A couple of her
favourite students had answers before me but none of them gave a comperhensive
enough explanation.
But then I connected the dots, she hinted at this in our last class.  
"It's because of transportation." - I say confidently.

And indeed, transportation has changed our tempo of life.

The more free time you have the more you realize you're not as productive
as you want to be. This concept of wasted productivity is a slippery slope into
capitalistic dystopias.

- Subtitles on films are slow, and lengthy. Tiktoks may go down to one word.

Media has converted from text to movies to youtube to tiktok.
