## Or why it's hard to live by nihilism

The human condition is the inevitable byproduct of evolution in a nihilistic world.

See when selective breeding is beneficial,
how abstraction/generalization can save us a lot of work,
and why you shouldn't actually be selling weed.

## Backstory

I was feeling a little bit depressed and went to grab myself a can of beans from the cabinet under the kitchen's sink.
While I was searching for one, I noticed a lot of other packaged foods I'd probably never eat that just take up space, and I wondered what this space could be better used for.

A sudden intrusive thought - grow weed. That's probably the most *profitable* way to utilize an under-the-kitchen-sink cabinet.  
With recent times, a culture around growing weed (legally and otherwise) has formed and a big aspect of it is the rebirth of our generation's interest in agriculture.
Humans have always been fascinated by the idea of playing God through the morphing of the natural ways of flora and fauna - i.e. **selective breeding**.
This ~~lost art~~.

## Selective breeding
### In plants

Genetic modifications and other methods of *phenotype control* are also popular today, but selective breeding remains a primary practice due to its simplicity, effectiveness and being well-researched.

<!-- TODO: Add a wiki-style card -->
> the process by which humans use animal breeding and plant breeding to selectively develop particular phenotypic traits (characteristics) by choosing which typically animal or plant males and females will sexually reproduce and have offspring together.

### In humans

#### Homo sapiens

Some text

> Flowers, **vegetables** and fruit-trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non-commercial professionals: major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals.
> The deliberate exploitation of selective breeding to produce desired results has become very common in agriculture and experimental biology.

#### Homo erectus

Some more text

> Selective breeding can be unintentional, e.g., resulting from the process of human cultivation; and it may also produce unintended – desirable or undesirable – results.
> Most likely, there has been an interdependence between natural and artificial factors that have resulted in plant domestication.
