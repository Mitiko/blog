Core concepts:
- memory
- learning (just memory + reinforcement)
- reinforcement = reward system

Memory (layered):
- evolutionary (slow)
  - morphological (relating to structural changes / anatomy / biomimetics)
  - endocrine (relating to hormones)
- instincts (immediate reaction)
- intuition (delayed reaction)
- < maybe missing something >
- metacognition (higher order reasoning)
