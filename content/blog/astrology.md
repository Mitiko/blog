Desire is a great thing. Everybody desires a nice life, with good friends,
being happy, etc. We want to achieve our desires, so how could one exploit them.
Exploitation of desires is when your goals get perverted (by the exploitator)
for their (usually a corporation) benefit.
Examples:
Most holidays - chrismas shopping, valentines day, etc.
