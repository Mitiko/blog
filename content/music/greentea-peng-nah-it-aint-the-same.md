Nah, it ain't the same
Being a man today
Nah, it ain't the same, nah, it ain't the same
Being a man today
Nah, it ain't the same

<span class="l1">Waking up to this disarray
This uncertainness only seems to serve the misery</span>
Maya place on me, mother take from me
<span class="l1">All of this false shit, I do not need it
I believe in magic because I've seen it</span>
Nothing new, the ego, you know already how it goes
I've got a strong mind, strong girl
<span class="l1">From my head to my toe, back to my ego<br>
These earthly habits, they've got to gеt going
I've let go of desirеs, but I have truly let go of the fires
That burn them and fuel them</span>
It's so hard to be human
With a battling mind
I have lost all devotion over time
I'm on the path of remembrance
And I'm remembering fine, having nothing that's mine

<span class="l1">Only borrowing time, my kind
Chatting to God, unworthy of His time</span>
With all these doubts in my mind
Cannot cast aside, left to struggle in my rhymes

Nah, it ain't the same being a man today
Nah, it ain't the same, nah, it ain't the same
Being a man today
Nah, it ain't the same (nah, it ain't the same)
Being a man today (being a man today)

Inner battles dwell like city kids beneath the poverty line
I'm feeding my senses
<span class="l1">Food for thought is money well spent-ed
'Cause most of our so-called knowledge is rented, invented
Depends-es on flippant friends-es
Social scenarios, hollow like Cheerios</span>
You hear me though
Never thought I'd be coming out your stereo
But there we go, maktub, y'all
<span class="l1">It's written, you know</span>

Nah, it ain't the same
Being a man today
Nah, it ain't the same, nah, it ain't the same
Being a man today
Nah, it ain't the same (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Being a man today (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

No, it ain't the same
Being a man today
No, it ain't the same
No, it ain't the same
No, it ain't the same

Being a man today
Being a man today
Being a man today
(Yeah, man, yeah, man)
Being a man today (yeah, man, yeah, man)
Being a man today (yeah, man, yeah, man)
Being a man today
Being a man today

It ain't the same, nah, it ain't the same, yeah
No, it ain't the same
Being a man today
No, it ain't the same
(Man made, man made)
Being a man today
Inner battles dwell like city kids beneath the poverty line
I'm feeding my senses
