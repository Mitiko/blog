<span class="l1">The day that I met you I started dreaming.</span>
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time.
I don't know that much about Kingston.
<span class="l1">But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain.</span>
I think that tonight I'll leave my light on,
'cause I get lonely when it's out and <span class="l1">I miss you right about now.</span>

Baby, tell me where you wanna goooo.
Baby, tell me what you wanna knowwww.
Give you everything I have and moreeee.

He said, "baby," _that's what he called me_, "I love you".
<span class="l1">Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way.
It's the thought of you that slightly scares me
but it takes my breath away, forget what I was gonna say.</span>
The day that I met you, I started dreaming.
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time.

Baby, tell me where you wanna goooo.
Baby, tell me what you wanna knowwww.
Give you everything I have and moreeee.

Baby, tell me where you wanna goooo.
Baby, tell me what you wanna knowwww.
Give you everything I have and moreeee.

Baby, tell me where you wanna goooo.
Baby, tell me what you wanna knowwww.
Give you everything I have and moreeee.
