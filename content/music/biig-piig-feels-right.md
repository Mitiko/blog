Outside, my guy is try'na find a little spare time;
unwind with me a minute,
I've got red wine, no lie.
<span class="l1">And since there's two of us,
let's put the tunes on up loud.
I wanna see what you make me do
and how.</span>
I know you think it may be too soon.
Come 'round and show me what you've got.

I heard you wanna be in the driver's seat
so keep up!
And do you promise me that you'll honor me?
Don't give up.
'Cause it feels right:

And if I follow you, I know that I should hesitate, but it feels right.
And just the thought of you gives me the taste I know I'll crave.
But it feels right!
And if I follow you, I know that I should hesitate, but it feels right.
And just the thought of you gives me the taste I know I'll crave.
But it feels right!

Fine lines -
don't step unless you're ready now to make him upset.
I wouldn't take you for the shy type,
not yet, but then again who knows?
Honey, there's no ties, no net;
you've gotta follow with your instinct;
what's next?
No sense in trying to find reason or regret
when nothing's set in stone.

so keep up!</span>
And do you promise me that you'll honor me?
Don't give up.

And just the thought of you gives me the taste I know I'll crave.
