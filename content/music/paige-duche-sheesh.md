<span class="l1">**Damn!**</span> Now what you expect?
Apologize for all the damage,
man I was just tryina be smooth.

Throw you for a loop,
I just wanna be amused;
<span class="l1">now tell me do you think I'm cool?</span>

<span class="l1">I'm just tryina show off,
I can make your jaw drop,</span>
maybe they'd call me a fool.

_A fucking fool? Are you kidding?!_

Now **listen!**
I'm not tryina prove myself,
I don't do this for the else,
<span class="l1">I just wanna make a mark,</span>
strike a spark; **Listen,**
I don't want to keep it down,
gotta loud fuckin mouth,
let me take you through the dark -
know the parts -
Way too..
way too down come floatin'
through this sound be open.
As you drown come floatin'
with me now.

**Damn!** Teachin' you a lesson.
<span class="l1">Tell me what's up on your chest
and then you can make it out of this nightmare.</span>
I am not the reason why
that you finally found the light
<span class="l1">trapped inside a room of despair.</span>

Baby this is all you.
I'm just here to make you move,
take a seat now let's prepare.

_Dude, we gotta get outta here!_

Now **listen!** I'm not tryina bring ya down,
I'm just tryina get ya out,
<span class="l1">there's a reason that I'm here -</span>
make you feel.. **Listen!**
Maybe what I say is harsh,
maybe all this shit is hard
but your feels will finally clear, disappear.
Way too..
way too down come floatin'
through this sound be open.
As you drown come floatin'
with me now.

_Let me deep inside of your mind,_
_I can help you change and unwind._
_There you go, you're making it right,_
_you're making it right._

Damn!
