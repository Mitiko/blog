What the fuck am I waiting for,
someone to push me back?
On the low, I don’t wanna move foward -
stuck in past.

<span class="l1">I’ll play games with my mind
waiting for the silence.</span>
If I get my cards right
I don’t have to use violence.

Wrong move and I’ll walk in circles with myself -
here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go!
Get caught, is there any hope of getting out -
down down down down down down down down down.

Who the fuck am I waiting for;
all I have is myself.
No prince, gotta move it to the door -
I’m all that counts.

I’ll play games with my mind
waiting for the silence.
<span class="l1">If I get my cards right
I don’t have to use violence.</span>

Wrong move and I’ll walk in circles with myself -
here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go!
Get caught, is there any hope of getting out -
down down down down down down down down down.

What if I move faster? What if I move faster?
What if I move faster? What if I move faster?

Wrong move and I’ll walk in circles with myself -
here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go!
Get caught, is there any hope of getting out -
down down down down down.

Wrong move and I’ll walk in circles with myself -
here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go!
Get caught, is there any hope of getting out -
down down down down down down down down down.
