Hannah, my darling,
I will follow you into the sunrise under desert sky.
We fly, rise together with our hearts
upon our sleeves for all to see.
We two will breathe - aqua queen,
though vast distance between us,
heart sails with love for you.
I love you, I love you, I do.
Love you, I love you, I love you, I do.

Nakamarra, sweet red earth
will hold you like the strength you bless to me.
True, we engage humility.
<span class="l1">Watch me struggle with your words
however truthful they may be.</span>
We'll see in time, opening our hearts
and nurturing our minds to shine.
I love you, love you, I love you, I do.
Love you, I love you, I love you, I do.

<span class="l1">Oh, it sets our hearts to fire, sweeps you and I.</span>
Honey don't you,
know - it sets our heart to fire, sweeps you and I.
Honey don't you,
know - we too will pulse in through this light.
Honey don't you,
know - we two will pulse..
I'll always love you. _yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah_
Love you. _yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah_
Love you, I do.
Love you. _yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah_
Love you. _yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah_
Love you, I do.
