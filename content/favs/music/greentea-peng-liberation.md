Mmm, mmm
Mmm

What do you do when you're lost for words?
Try claw at another verse,
sit still 'til you press reverse, then it hurts.
See ya later, I'm long gone now;
<span class="l1">I'll be back, but I don't know when or how, nah.</span>

Lost your name of the side of my page.
He was far when I tried to engage in conversation.
Left me there on the side of the road.
Don't feel bad, told you - <span class="l1">"You do not owe me inspiration."</span>
Yeah, I'm trying to lose my mind;
to elevate, yeah, it takes a lifetime -
<span class="l1">I don't mind, I'm searching for my liberation.</span>
I, I (I, I)

<span class="l2">Like you in the morning when you're quiet and still and there's room to breathe</span>
I ain't smoked today, 'cause I ain't got no money
Nah, it ain't all sunny, but found a boy and he's lovely
Golden just like honey
Yeah, you taste like honey
