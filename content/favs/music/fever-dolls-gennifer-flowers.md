## Intro



## Lyrics from album cover

Adam says to Lillith, girl the verdict’s
returned, and submission is what he
ordered or your body to burn. Lillith
says to Adam, I’ll save you the trip, and
she jumped into the fire like it didn’t
exist. Singing songs to seven sisters
while the skin left her lips, I’d rather
die than compromise a single sin I’ve
committed.

She cut her wrists on politics, and the
power of making money turning
powerful tricks; Getting mixed up in
the offices of ethically-lapsed fact
detainment. And if I got the power to
take it, *the power to fake it*, Gennifer
Flowers got the power to shake her
debasement.

And if I tell you that I’m one step closer
to God, and if I tell you that I’m one
step closer to God: that’s the step that’ll
send you past the edge of the top -
don’t forget the mess that you left at
the bottom. Hey Commander, what’s
the answer at hand, you got a five step
plan to keep your ass in demand?

**Step One**: Harness the water flowing
under the moon. **Step Two**: Harness
the debt unless it’s hard to reduce. **Step
Three**: Harness the strength of
populations removed. **Step Four**:
Harness the promise that we never
renewed. **Step Five**: Just hold a vote so
we can tell them we tried, I’m yelling
'Skinned alive, skinned alive, goodness
all good saints have died!'

You’re coming down, quit messing around
or you’ll break it - I know a pretty little place
where we can get caked and wasted.

And if I’ve got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement!
Shake her debasement!
Shake her debaaaaaasement!
Shaker her debasement!
And if I’ve got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement!

Hold me, hold me baby, I think the state of
the world’s starting to shape me. And when
you’re shaking it girl, you start to change
me. The five o clock report says we’re crazy.
Pull it together cause we’re coming apart,
and the preacher says the devil loves a
sensitive heart.

Eddie made a record cause he wanted to
prove that he could harness the feel of
when he played in a room. But the feeling
fell flat, and his songs sound pretty vacant.

And if I’ve got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement!
Shake her debasement!
Shake her debaaaaaasement!
Shaker her debasement!
And if I’ve got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement!

Adam says to Lillith, girl the verdict’s returned,
and submission is what he ordered or your body to burn.
Lillith says to Adam, I’ll save you the trip,
and she jumped into the fire like it didn’t exist.
Singing songs to seven sisters while the skin left her lips,
I’d rather die than compromise a single sin I’ve committed.

She cut her wrists on politics,
and the power of making money turning powerful tricks;
Getting mixed up in the offices of ethically-lapsed fact detainment.
And if I got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement.

And if I tell you that I’m one step closer to God,
and if I tell you that I’m one step closer to God:
that’s the step that’ll send you past the edge of the top -

Shake her debasement!
