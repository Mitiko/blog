## Intro

*Oh, hello I didn't hear you come in but I'm certainly glad that you did.
My name is Evan Alice and I'm excited to share with you the latest in our groundbreaking effort to provide an array of products and experiences for the modern american.*

*For nearly 20 years entrepreneurs, scientists and visionaries have struggled to understand what changes the new millennium would bring to the ways in which we experience art and consume entertainment.
One thing's for sure Haas - it's out with the old and in with the new.
But don't worry old-timer, you can still come along, provided you bring that fresh perspective intel.*

<span class="l1">*What's clear is that today's Americans want to be inundated and stimulated like never before. No longer will we abide the demarcations of medium or the limits placed on us by such dated concepts as story, and structure, and genre.*</span>
*After all, what good are comfort and tidiness in a world where the most emotionally devastating conversations can occur when you're holding in a fart or something.
It's in this spirit that I'm proud to announce our latest venture: Fever Dolls -
a multimedia varietal experience drawing on the hottest and freshest sounds in modern sensory consumption, all in stereo.*

*Along with myself, my associates in this venture:
Patrick Freeman, Ren Malloy, Mitchell Parrish, Eric Benopee and Daniel Fulham,
will be joining me in launching a new kind of variety hour.
One that lasts 24 hours a day in seven days a week.
Saddle up partner because anything can happen and anyone can stop by!*

## Lyrics

Adam says to Lillith, girl the verdict’s returned,
<span class="l1">and submission is what he ordered or your body to burn.
Lillith says to Adam, I’ll save you the trip,
and she jumped into the fire like it didn’t exist.</span>
Singing songs to seven sisters while the skin left her lips,
<span class="l1">I’d rather die than compromise a single sin I’ve committed.</span>

<span class="l1">She cut her wrists on politics,</span>
and the power of making money turning powerful tricks;
Getting mixed up in the offices of ethically-lapsed fact detainment.
And if I got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement.

And if I tell you that I’m one step closer to God,
<span class="l1">and if I tell you that I’m one step closer to God:
that’s the step that’ll send you past the edge of the top -
don’t forget the mess that you left at the bottom.</span>
Hey Commander, what’s the answer at hand,
you got a five step plan to keep your ass in demand?

**Step One**: Harness the water flowing under the moon.
**Step Two**: Harness the debt unless it’s hard to reduce.
**Step Three**: Harness the strength of populations removed.
**Step Four**: Harness the promise that we never renewed.
<span class="l1">**Step Five**: Just hold a vote so we can tell them we tried, I’m yelling.
"Skinned alive, skinned alive, goodness all good saints have died!"</span>

You’re coming down,
quit messing around or you’ll break it -
I know a pretty little place where we can get caked and wasted.

And if I’ve got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement!
Shake her debasement!
Shake her debaaaaaasement!
Shaker her debasement!
And if I’ve got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement!

Hold me, hold me baby,
I think the state of the world’s starting to shape me.
And when you’re shaking it girl, you start to change me.
The five o clock report says we’re crazy.
Pull it together cause we’re coming apart,
<span class="l1">and the preacher says the devil loves a sensitive heart.</span>

Eddie made a record cause he wanted to prove
that he could harness the feel of when he played in a room.
But the feeling fell flat,
and his songs sound pretty vacant.

And if I’ve got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement!
Shake her debasement!
Shake her debaaaaaasement!
Shaker her debasement!
And if I’ve got the power to take it, *the power to fake it*,
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement!
