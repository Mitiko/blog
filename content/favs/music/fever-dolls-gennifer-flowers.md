Adam says to Lillith, girl the verdict’s returned
And submission is what he ordered or your body to burn
Lillith says to Adam I’ll save you the trip
And she jumped into the fire like it didn’t exist
Singing songs to seven sisters while the skin left her lips
I’d rather die than compromise a single sin I’ve committed
She cut her wrists on politics
And the power of making money turning powerful tricks
Getting mixed up in the offices of ethically-lapsed fact detainment
And if I got the power to take it, the power to fake it
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement
And if I tell you that I’m one step closer to God
And if I tell you that I’m one step closer to God
That’s the step that’ll send you past the edge of the top
Don’t forget the mess that you left at the bottom
Hey Commander, what’s the answer at hand
You got a five step plan to keep your ass in demand?
Step One: Harness the water flowing under the moon
Step Two: Harness the debt unless it’s hard to reduce
Step Three: Harness the strength of populations removed
Step Four: Harness the promise that we never renewed
Step Five: Just hold a vote so we can tell them we tried, I’m yelling
Skinned alive, skinned alive, goodness all good saints have died
You’re coming down
Quit messing around or you’ll break it
I know a pretty little place where we can get caked and wasted
And if I’ve got the power to take it, the power to fake it
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement
Shake her debasement
Shake her debasement
Shaker her debasement
And if I’ve got the power to take it, the power to fake it
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement
Hold me, hold me baby
I think the state of the world’s starting to shape me
And when you’re shaking it girl, you start to change me
The five o clock report says we’re crazy
Pull it together cause we’re coming apart
And the preacher says the devil loves a sensitive heart
Eddie made a record cause he wanted to prove
(It’s the face of a venerable kind)
That he could harness the feel of when he played in a room
(Passing the space where they spent all their time)
But the feeling fell flat
(And the youth fall disgraced by their animal minds)
And his songs sound pretty vacant
(Singing love lost the race, but she loves what she finds)
And if I’ve got the power to take it, the power to fake it
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement
Shake her debasement
Shake her debasement
Shaker her debasement
And if I’ve got the power to take it, the power to fake it
Gennifer Flowers got the power to shake her debasement
