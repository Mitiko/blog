It's different for girls -
they've got sensitive language,
they've built miles of defenses,
they're not numbed by oppression.

It's different for girls!
From when they are children, they're depersonalized,
aggressively objectified.
They want to make a scene,
they want to be adored,
and then they want to be left alone when they get bored with that.

It's different for girls
<span class="l1">They are mercurial creatures, not a masculine dissonance
or sexual currency.</span>

<span class="l1">Though some women are demons, all of them are gods.. _gods_, _gods_.</span>
Though some demons are women... _men_, _..men_.
For every one psycho bitch, there's ten thousand aggro pricks.
It's different for girls!

It's different for girls -
they don't spit on the streets,
they don't piss on the seat,
<span class="l1">they don't have to size up every person they meet
or create an elite
or poison the game so no one else can compete.</span>
They like chaos and mystery
and they like to combine them.
Sometimes they act crazy
but that doesn't define them.

It's different for girls -
they're not expected to fight,
they're expected to sit and take some lesser man's shit,
though it don't feel right.

No, it don't feel right.

Though some women are demons, all of them are god.. _god_, _god_.
Though some demons are women... _men_, _..men_.
For every one psycho chick, there's ten thousand hateful pricks.
It's different.
It's different.
It's diff..er..ent.

Yeah, it's different for girls!
It's different for girls.
