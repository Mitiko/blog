# Reference

Not so common commands I often forget.

## CI/CD

<!-- Haven't configured a way to skip deployments with Cloudflare yet -->
`tf-apply` and `tf-destroy` in commit message run terraform.

## Latex

\mathcal{S} -> fancy symbols (by default capital letters are not fancy-fied)  
\mid -> conditional probability  
\quad -> spacing  
\qquad -> double space

## Markdown

```md
